Crushed stone aggregates are obtained from various quarries and crushed to specific sizes. They are known for their strength and durability, making them suitable for a wide range of construction applications. Crushed stone aggregates are often used as a base material for concrete and asphalt production, as well as in the construction of roads, bridges, and retaining walls.</p><p>Lastly, another type of crushed aggregate commonly used in Pakistan is sand.
