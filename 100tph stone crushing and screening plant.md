<h3>100tph stone crushing and screening plant</h3><img src='1706755370.jpg' alt=''><p>The stone crushing and screening plant has been successfully manufactured and delivered to a client in Asia earlier this year. With its efficient 100tph crushing capacity, it easily meets the high demands of the construction and mining industries.</p><p>The plant consists of a primary jaw crusher, secondary cone crusher, tertiary vertical shaft impact crusher, and vibrating screens. These machines are operated in a closed-circuit system, ensuring minimal pollution and further enhancing the efficiency of the crushing process.</p><p>The primary jaw crusher, which breaks down the large stones into smaller pieces, operates through the use of an electric motor. It has a feed opening of 950 x 380 mm and a maximum feed size capacity of 75-200 mm. This allows for a quick and efficient crushing process, reducing the time and energy required for the subsequent stages.</p><p>The secondary cone crusher operates through a powerful electric motor, ensuring a high crushing efficiency. It has a feed opening of 1000 mm and a maximum feed size capacity of 120-200 mm. The cone crusher is known for its versatility and can handle a wide range of materials, making it suitable for various applications.</p><p>The tertiary vertical shaft impact crusher, known for its superior shaping capabilities, operates through an 185 kW electric motor. This crusher is especially designed to produce high-quality cubical end-products and is an ideal choice for the production of sand and aggregate.</p><p>The vibrating screens, which are powered by electric motors, efficiently separate the crushed materials into different sizes, thus ensuring a uniform final product. They are designed with multiple decks, allowing for the separation of different size fractions simultaneously.</p><p>Overall, the 100tph stone crushing and screening plant provides an efficient, reliable and superior crushing solution for the construction and mining industries. With its low environmental impact, it is a cost-effective and sustainable option for large-scale quarry operations.</p><p>In conclusion, the 100tph stone crushing and screening plant is an ideal choice for producing high-quality end products from a wide range of materials. Its efficiency and reliability make it an excellent investment for the future.</p><h3>Contact us</h3><ul><li><strong>Whatsapp:&nbsp;<a href="https://wa.me/8613661969651">+8613661969651</a></strong></li><li><a href="https://swt.shibang-china.com/?git&amp;zhl&amp;100tph stone crushing and screening plant"><strong>Online Service(chat now)</strong></a></li></ul><h3>Related</h3><ul><li><a href='iron ore cruseher plant price.md'>iron ore cruseher plant price</a></li><li><a href='how to make a talcum powder.md'>how to make a talcum powder</a></li><li><a href='talcum powder making formulation.md'>talcum powder making formulation</a></li><li><a href='small cone crushers.md'>small cone crushers</a></li><li><a href='cement clinker grinding unit.md'>cement clinker grinding unit</a></li></ul>
